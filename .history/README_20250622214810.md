# PiggyVest Landing Page Clone (React + Vite)

This project is a React-based clone of the PiggyVest landing page, built with Vite for fast development and modern tooling. It closely mirrors the original PiggyVest homepage, with a focus on clean structure, modular components, and maintainable code.

## Features
- Faithful recreation of the PiggyVest landing page UI
- All images and icons loaded from the `src/assets` folder using React imports
- Section-by-section React components for easy maintenance
- Responsive layout and organized CSS for each section
- Layman-friendly comments in all major components

## Getting Started
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. **Start the development server:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Open your browser:**
   Visit [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view the app.

## Notes
- All images must be placed in `src/assets` and imported in components (not referenced as `/assets/...`).
- For any layout or alignment issues, adjust the relevant CSS files in `src/components/`.
- The project is organized for clarity and easy updates.
